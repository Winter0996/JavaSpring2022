# JavaArray
This program is an assignment on arrays using an integer array to find student grades 
We initialized the array with a size of 10 with each element having a value of 0 to 100 
We used different methods outside of the main function to use different ways we can use arrays in java
We learned how to find and print the array in reverse, shuffle the elements, find the max and minimum value, and the average of all the elements in the array
